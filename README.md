- **Topical Hub**: A user who follows or interacts with many authorities in a specific topic.
- **Topical Authority**: A user who creates influential content that topical hubs engage with.
- **Cross-Network Discovery**: Analyzing user roles across multiple OSNs to find patterns and hidden influencers.

- **Operating System** - Windows XP
- **Coding Language** - Java/J2EE(JSP,Servlet)
- **Front End** - J2EE
- **Back End** - MySQL
## Applications:
- Marketing and advertising
- Trend discovery
- Social network analysis

## Conclusion
MPHAT effectively models user influence across multiple OSNs, outperforming traditional models in topic discovery, link prediction, and platform-specific influence detection.
